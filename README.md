## Building Setup

### Nativescript

First [setup Nativescript](https://docs.nativescript.org/setup/linux)

This project is optimized to be built with [Akylas Fork](https://github.com/Akylas/NativeScript). Though it would work with main it is best to use this fork. The `package.json` defines a resolution to `../NativeScript/dist/packages/core` so clone the fork and build it using `npm run setup:yarn && npm run ui-mobile-base:build && npm run core:build`

### Yarn

You need to use yarn with this project as it uses the `portal:` protocol for some dependencies.
Note that the project has some `yarn link` for easy local dev for me. The best is for you to remove the `resolutions` part of the `package.json`

### Building

Now that all is setup and that you prepared the 3rd party libraries you can actually build and run the app:

* `yarn`
* `ns run android --no-hmr --env.devlog` (replace by `ios` for iOS...)

This should run the app on the first discovered device or emulator.
